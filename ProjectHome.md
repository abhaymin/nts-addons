The are some function implementation which is present in JUMP framework that can be ported into NTS suites like the following geometry operations.

"Geometries\Operation\LengthSubstring.cs"
"Geometries\Operation\LengthToPoint.cs"
"Geometries\Operation\LocatePoint.cs"
"Geometries\Operation\PointPairDistance.cs"
"Geometries\Operation\VertexHausdorffDistance.cs"
"Geometries\Operation\EuclideanDistanceToPoint.cs"

In future I would like to attempt the porting of the JUMP and JCS framework it self to dotNet, but if I have time to do so.
